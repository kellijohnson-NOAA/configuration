Thanks for opening a pull request (PR)!
Everything inside of the less than!--- and --greater than is an html comment to
help you navigate submitting this PR. This commented text as well as other
comments will **NOT** appear in the final PR. If you do not believe me, just
toggle between Write and Preview to see what your PR will look like without the
comments.

General instructions are as follows:
Please read the html comment under each heading and follow the instructions.
For smaller changes, feel free to skip sections not flagged as "MANDATORY" but
please do not delete any of the section headers just leave the section blank.
